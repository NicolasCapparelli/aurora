# Agent contract

Continuity is this project's primary documentation home for understanding, changing, and resuming work. Read [what Continuity is](../about.md) when unfamiliar with it. Full documentation migration is optional and requires explicit user approval; discovering its prompt is not authorization.

Follow applicable repository instructions. At task/session start read this file, [status](../status.md), and the complete [map](map.md); reuse unchanged loaded context. Match request vocabulary/boundaries, then read only relevant model sections, local guides, source, and tests. Follow dependencies and expand investigation when evidence warrants it.

Inspect actual source before changing behavior. Missing/stale routes: search source, establish ownership, repair the map. Routing never prohibits investigation. Read user guides for affected user behavior and decisions/history only when their reasoning matters. Avoid recursive documentation/schema reads and vendor/generated/build/dependency orientation unless needed; use map exclusions.

Initialization is the broad-coverage exception: inventory/search first, then inspect substantive source across capabilities. Never blindly ingest every file.

## Every commit and handoff

Commit only when otherwise authorized. Before each commit and every handoff, including uncommitted work:

1. Review the relevant diff; update affected docs with implementation. For partial commits, describe committed behavior accurately and distinguish outstanding working-tree changes. Intermediate edits may defer updates until this boundary.
2. Review status; update changed state, stopping point, next steps, blockers, or verification. State no active work/no established next task when applicable. History alone does not establish human intent.
3. Check changed links/routes. Report actual checks, results, scope, tested code state, and uncertainty. Source inspection is not runtime verification; never claim an unrun check or identify a future documentation commit as tested.

| Change | Documentation / investigation |
| --- | --- |
| Component added/moved/removed/reassigned | Map/local guide; architecture if overall design changes |
| Data access/validation/serialization/identity/relationship/lifecycle | Model/schema routes; producers, consumers, conversions, migrations |
| User behavior | Affected usage/troubleshooting |
| Setup/commands/configuration/verification | Setup and verification routes |
| Consequential durable decision | Architecture or optional decision record |
| State/unfinished work | Status |

No ceremonial edits: review can require no change. Keep one home per fact; label plans, inferences, unknowns. Preserve existing rules and discovery pointers. Tools without root-file discovery need an explicit instruction pointing here; compliance is not guaranteed.
